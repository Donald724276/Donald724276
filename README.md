## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there!! I am **Donald J. Oommen**, a first year BSc Computer Science student specializing in AI at the **University of Greenwich**. I'm passionate about technology and am always looking to learn something new!

### Current Projects
I'm about to kick off an exciting challenge: a **100 Day, 100 Projects** journey where I'll build Python projects that progressively increase in difficulty. Even though I'm just starting, this challenge will be an excellent way to practice, grow my skills, and gain real-world experience.

### Skills & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Scheme, JavaScript  
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS  
- **Database Management:** SQL and RDBMSs  

I enjoy exploring a variety of technologies and refining my craft as I tackle different challenges.

### What I'm Learning
I'm expanding my horizons in several areas:
- **Functional Programming:** Delving deep into Scheme and other functional paradigms.
- **App Development:** Learning how to design and develop engaging applications.
- **Neural Networks:** Engineering and experimenting with neural networks to further my understanding of AI.

### Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on projects of any kind. If you've got an idea or a challenge, let's team up and create something amazing together!

### Fun Facts
Outside of coding, I'm an avid reader who loves mythofiction, mangas, manhwas, and moreâ€”Iâ€™m a self-confessed otaku! Music is another major part of my life; I play the guitar and even perform with a Worship band.
